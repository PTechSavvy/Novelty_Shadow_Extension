🎯 The Challenge  
How can we enable organizations to identify and stop Shadow IT activities before they cause security breaches, compliance issues, or data leaks?  
Across Africa and beyond, many companies face a hidden but growing risk—Shadow IT. Employees often install unauthorized browser extensions, use unvetted online tools, or connect to unsanctioned cloud services, unknowingly exposing their organizations to data exposure, malware, and regulatory non-compliance. Existing solutions tend to be overly complex, reactive, or geared towards large enterprises with substantial security budgets.

✨ Our Solution  
Introducing Novelty Verify: a smart, lightweight Chrome browser extension combined with an AI-driven dashboard that empowers IT teams to detect Shadow IT early and respond effectively.  
Novelty Verify quietly runs on employees’ devices, scanning for unapproved web tools, extensions, cloud service usage, and suspicious behavioral patterns. When risks are detected, the platform sends real-time alerts, assigns risk scores, and offers automated recommendations on a centralized web dashboard.  

What makes Novelty Verify unique:  
🚨 Proactive Detection: It predicts potential threats by analyzing usage patterns, extension details, and access behaviors before damage occurs.  
🔍 Non-Intrusive Operation: The extension works seamlessly in the background, with minimal performance impact and no complicated installation.  
🎯 Tailored for African SMEs: Unlike bulky enterprise-only solutions, Novelty Verify is affordable, scalable, and specifically designed for small and medium-sized African businesses, which are often overlooked yet highly vulnerable.  
🧠 AI-Driven Risk Assessment: Our backend uses machine learning to contextualize and categorize behaviors, assessing risk not just based on what is being used but why it poses a threat.  
✅ User-Friendly Design: Every part of the system—from timely alerts to comprehensive dashboard views—is designed for clarity, ease of use, and quick decision-making.

As data protection regulations tighten and cyber threats evolve rapidly in the region, Novelty Verify fills the gap between security needs and simplicity, offering African businesses a smart, accessible, and context-aware tool to prevent Shadow IT risks.  
By giving IT teams early visibility and centralized control, we don’t just detect threats — we build a new standard of digital trust for African organizations.
